## some unity examples

I'm playing with Unity3D, learning and evaluating it for a couple app ideas.  This repo hopes to have sample games/apps/junk that I've made, including various versions.

Source code for most of these will be available, until we start making stuff with our proprietary art.

I'm putting them in this repo with the hopes that it will work on Github via gh-pages branch, *and* on my static website as a submodule.
